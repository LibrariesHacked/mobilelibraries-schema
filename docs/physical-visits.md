### Definition

---

A physical visit is defined as an individual entering the library premises - for whatever reason.
For co-located premises this may mean counting visits that are not specifically for using library services. To show that premises are co-located use the relevant columns in the [libraries dataset](https://schema.librarydata.uk/libraries).

### How the data can be collected

---

An automatic people counter at the the entrance of the space occupied by the library is ideal. However, it is up to each service to decide how they collect this data. Sometimes libraries within the same service will each use a different system to count physical visits. This is fine as long as it is clearly explained in the count type field and in the dataset metadata.

If starting from scratch, a [physical visits template file](https://github.com/LibrariesHacked/schema-librarydata/blob/master/templates/physical_visits.csv) can be downloaded and opened using spreadsheet software.

### Sample data row

| Local authority | Library name | Count start | Count end | Count type | Visits |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Newcastle City Council | Outer West | 2019-02-11 | 2019-02-17 | Manual (one week every quarter) | 767 |

### Field notes

---

#### Count start / Count end

The count start and end is the report period the count is for.

Detailed reporting is encouraged. For example, the reporting could be on a daily basis, in which case the start and end would be the same. This would be good for analysis, such as comparing library use on different days of the week.
