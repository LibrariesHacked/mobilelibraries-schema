These pages describe a core dataset for public library open data. Having standard data will enable local services to share data analysis, and build open applications from that data.

> The core dataset is intended to be a series of data which all library services will collect, use and publish to help inform and improve local library service delivery

> We will ‘fix our plumbing’ to break our dependence on inflexible and expensive technology that doesn’t join up effectively. This means insisting on modular building blocks for the IT we rely on, and open standards to give a common structure to the data we create.
