### Definition

A physical visit is defined as an individual entering the library premises - for whatever reason.
For co-located premises this may mean counting visits that are not specifically for using library services. To show that premises are co-located use the relevant columns in the [libraries dataset](https://schema.librarydata.uk/libraries).

### How the data can be collected

An automatic people counter at the the entrance of the space occupied by the library is ideal. However, it is up to each service to decide how they collect this data. Sometimes libraries within the same service will each use a different system to count physical visits. This is fine as long as it is clearly explained in the count type field and in the dataset metadata.

### Sample data row

| Field name 1 | Field name 2 | 
| ------------ | ------------ |
| Example value for field 1 | Example value for field 2 |

If starting from scratch, a [physical visits template file](https://github.com/LibrariesHacked/schema-librarydata/blob/master/templates/physical_visits.csv) can be downloaded and opened using spreadsheet software.

### Field notes

---

#### Field title

These sections should only be completed for fields where it is worth providing additional notes. For example, an opening hours column may need explanation of the data structure, and where the standard has been taken from.

### Potential problems

---

#### Problem title

A description of a problem that can occur, from our discussions. It could be a technical issue (size of dataset), a training requirement, common data problem, etc.

### How the data is updated

---

We aren't covering this in detail at this stage, but this can be a short indication of what should be done when the data is updated. For example, the data may be added to each time it is published (e.g. loans), or updated and replaced (e.g. libraries/mobile libraries).

### How the data could be used

---

An example of what could be done with the data.

### Future enhancements

---

#### Future enhancement title

Something that could be added later on that will bring extra value to the dataset. Will generally be something that is likely to be too difficult immediately.
