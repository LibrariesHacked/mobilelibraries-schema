### Definition

---

A library is a static service point which allows access to the general public to provide library services. This does not include mobile library services which are covered in a separate dataset.

### How the data can be collected

---

Manual collection. Library services will be able to use the library locations survey 2016 as a starting point.



### Sample data row


| Local authority | Library name | Address 1 | Address 2 | Address 3 | Postcode | Unique Property Reference Number | Statutory | Type of Library | Year opened | Year closed | Monday hours | Tuesday hours | Wednesday hours | Thursday hours | Friday hours | Saturday hours | Sunday hours | Special hours | Colocated | Colocated with | Notes | URL | Email address |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Plymouth  | Crownhill | Cross Park Road | Crownhill | | PL6 5AN | 100041062012 | Yes | LAL | 1991 | | 08:30-18:00| 08:30-18:00 | 08:30-18:00 | 08.30-20:00 | 08:30-18:00 | 09:00-17:00 | | | No | | | https://www.plymouth.gov.uk/libraries/findlibraryandopeninghours/crownhilllibrary | library@plymouth.gov.uk

### Field notes

---

#### Field title

These sections should only be completed for fields where it is worth providing additional notes. For example, an opening hours column may need explanation of the data structure, and where the standard has been taken from.

---

### Potential problems

#### Problem title

A description of a problem that can occur, from our discussions. It could be a technical issue (size of dataset), a training requirement, common data problem, etc.

### How the data is updated

---

We aren't covering this in detail at this stage, but this can be a short indication of what should be done when the data is updated. For example, the data may be added to each time it is published (e.g. loans), or updated and replaced (e.g. libraries/mobile libraries).

### How the data could be used

---

An example of what could be done with the data.

### Future enhancements

---

#### Future enhancement title

Something that could be added later on that will bring extra value to the dataset. Will generally be something that is likely to be too difficult immediately.
