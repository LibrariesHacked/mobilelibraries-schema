### Definition

---

A library member is a user registered with the library service, with a record in the library management system. The user does not need to specifically have borrowed an item within any timescale. It is assumed inactive users would be removed from the library system after an appropriate period of time in accordance with GDPR.

### How the data can be collected

---

Library management systems will have the means of extracting and reporting data on membership. It is unlikely that systems will be able to report the area codes required by this dataset so there will be the need for a tool to convert from postcodes to the area codes (see details below).

### Sample data row

| Local authority | Count date | Area code | Members |
| --------------- | ---------- | --------- | ------- |
| Bristol City Council | 2018-10-23 | E01014370 | 395 |

A full sample can be viewed at [Bristol membership](https://github.com/LibrariesHacked/schema-librarydata/blob/master/data/membership_bristol.csv).
