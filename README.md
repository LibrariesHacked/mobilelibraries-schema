# Library data schemas

This is a repository to hold open data schemas for public library data.

## Prerequisites

The schemas are written using Table Schema. To make use of this there are a lot of associated tools in various programming languages.

- [Table Schema Documentation](https://frictionlessdata.io/docs/table-schema/)
- [Frictionless Data Software Tools](https://frictionlessdata.io/software/)

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning.

Each schema will follow the same version number. If a new schema is added it will increment the version number of the current set, rather than start at 0.

All completed schemas will be held in the archived folder in this repository and the file name will include the version number. Schemas in development are held in the root folder.
