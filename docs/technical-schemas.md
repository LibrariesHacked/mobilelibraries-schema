### Schema definitions

---

[Table Schema](https://frictionlessdata.io/docs/table-schema/) is a standard for writing data schemas. It allows for a formal definition of what the columns should be in a dataset, and what type of data can be in each column.

This allows us to validate data with tools that can check whether files match the specified schema.

For our public library data, each dataset has it's own schema definition file. These can be viewed using the links below.
