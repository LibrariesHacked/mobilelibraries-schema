### Cloudflare cookie

This site uses [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/), to ensure we can provide the site using encryption (an HTTPS connection), as well as maximising the security and performance of the website.

Cloudflare set a single cookie on your computer when you use this website. The cookie is necessary to deliver their security services, such as identifying when a malicious user is suspected of atempting to overload a website. This would display a challenge to the user blocking them from repeated access.

This uses your IP address, but anonymises it so that it can not be identified. The cookie is not used for any personal tracking, or marketing purposes. More details are available at the [Cloudflare description of the use of cookies](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170156-Understanding-the-Cloudflare-Cookies#12345682).

### Tracking and analytics

There are no marketing or analytics trackers set on this website. We do not store your personal data in any way.

### GitHub pages

This site is hosted using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). Although this site has no tracking of user data, it is important to be aware that website hosting providers will also have logs that could include information such as your IP address.

GitHub has it's own [privacy statement](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement). The majority of this is in reference to logged-in services, but there is a reference to GitHub pages sites in this policy. This informs us that logs of visitor IP addresses can be used for security purposes. This does not include user tracking or marketing.

> Please note that GitHub may collect Technical Information from visitors to your GitHub Pages website, including logs of visitor IP addresses, to maintain the security and integrity of the website and service.
