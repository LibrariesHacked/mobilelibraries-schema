### Schema definitions

[Table Schema](https://frictionlessdata.io/docs/table-schema/) is a sepcification for writing 'schemas' for data. It allows for a formal definition of what the columns should be, and what type of data can be in each column.

This then allows us to validate data using tools that are able to check that the data matches the specified schema.

For the public library data, each dataset has it's own schema definition file. These can be viewed using the links below.
